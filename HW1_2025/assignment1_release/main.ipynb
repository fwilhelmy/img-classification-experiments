        "Empirical evidence over the years shows that training deep CNNs like ResNet18 using plain SGD (i.e., without momentum) generally converges more slowly and may get stuck in poor local minima. Momentum helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations, resulting in faster convergence and often better final performance.Given that momentum is a simple addition (and a well-established best practice), we prefer to compare only SGD with momentum.\n",

AdamW improves upon Adam by decoupling weight decay from the adaptive updates, which typically results in better performance on vision tasks. Therefore, instead of plain Adam, we choose AdamW as the representative adaptive optimizer.\n",
